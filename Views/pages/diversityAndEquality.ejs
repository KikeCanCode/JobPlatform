     <h1>Equality and Diversity</h1>

    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>CodeLeap</strong>, we are committed to building a fair, inclusive, and diverse platform that reflects the richness of the tech community we serve.
      We believe everyone—regardless of their background—should have equal access to opportunities that allow them to thrive in their career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to help <strong>software development bootcamp graduates</strong> break into the tech industry.
      We recognise that talent comes from all walks of life, and we are passionate about supporting individuals who bring unique perspectives, experiences, and ideas to the table.
    </p>

    <h2>Creating Equal Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
      CodeLeap ensures that all users—graduates, employers, and partners—are treated with fairness and respect.
      We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind based on:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Age</li>
      <li>Disability</li>
      <li>Gender identity or expression</li>
      <li>Marital or civil partnership status</li>
      <li>Pregnancy or maternity</li>
      <li>Race, ethnicity, or national origin</li>
      <li>Religion or belief</li>
      <li>Sex or sexual orientation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We encourage our employers and partners to share our commitment to equality by promoting inclusive recruitment practices that are based on skills, potential, and merit.
    </p>

    <h2>Supporting Diversity in Tech</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to close the gap between underrepresented groups and the tech industry by:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Highlighting inclusive employers who value diversity.</li>
      <li>Providing a platform that empowers graduates from all backgrounds to showcase their skills confidently.</li>
      <li>Offering resources and guidance to help everyone succeed—no matter their journey or starting point.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We celebrate the differences that make our community stronger. Together, we can create a tech industry that is innovative, inclusive, and accessible to all.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
    <p>
      CodeLeap continually reviews our policies and practices to ensure they promote equality and reflect our values.
      We are committed to learning, listening, and taking action to make our platform a safe, supportive, and empowering space for everyone.
